# H-Hope DIY energy harvester induction generator design

The role of the induction generator in the H-Hope energy harvester is to convert the mechanical energy of the cylinder into electric energy. As done for the mechanical design, the principle of operation is first described, then followed by a proposal of design.

## **Principle of operation of the H-Hope DIY energy harvester induction generator**
The principle of the operation of the DIY energy harvester induction generator is based on the principles of electromagnetic induction. It is composed of stator (coils, static) and rotor (permanent magnets, rotating). The permanent magnets generate the magnetic field *B* around them. When the rotor and permanent magnets rotate, so does the magnetic field *B*. The stator coils are mounted around the rotor, thus the magnetic field *B* crosses them and because the magnetic field rotates, the stator coils experience changing magnetic field *B*. Stator coils also experience changing magnetic flux *Φ*<sub>m</sub>, which can be thought of as being the product of the magnetic field *B* flowing through the surface of the coil *S*.

When the rotor rotates, using the principle of electromagnetic induction, a voltage *U*<sub>i</sub> is generated (=induced) on the stator coils.

The Equation (1), explaining the physics behind the voltage Ui induction process is a well-known Farraday (induction) equation:

$$
U_i = -\frac{\partial \Phi_m}{\partial t} \quad \text{(Eq. 1)}
$$

where the inducted voltage *U*<sub>i</sub> in the stator coils (for one coil turn) equals the rate of change (time derivative) of magnetic flux *Φ*<sub>m</sub>, which is the product of the magnetic field *B* flowing through the surface of the coil *S*. According to this law, the induced voltage is hence proportional to the:

 - magnetic field *B* strength (provided by the permanent magnets, rotating and attached to the induction generator rotor),
 - number of turns of wire in the stator coils, and 
 - rate of change of the magnetic field B flux *Φ*<sub>m</sub> through the surface *S* of the coils of the stator.

This voltage *U*<sub>i</sub> runs the current *I* through the coils of the induction generator, and depending on the external load, also through external circuits (batteries, sensors, etc,). The electric power *P*<sub>el</sub> of the induction generator (and of the VIV energy harvester if we consider the entire system) is

$$
P_{el} = I \cdot U_i \quad \text{(Eq. 2)}
$$

Besides the theoretical aspects of the electrical power generation, it is also possible to describe the mechanical aspects of power generation. The induction generator brakes the shaft and consumes mechanical power, generated by the cylinder.

Starting from the induction generator, the electrical force braking the induction generator is called the Lorentz force. It is proportional to the magnetic field *B* (produced by the permanent magnets), the current *I* (induced in the coils), and the total length of the coil winding (*l*) located within the reach of the magnetic field *B*:

$$
F = I \cdot l \cdot B \quad \text{(Eq. 3)}
$$

The rotation of the shaft, induced by the oscillating motion of the cylinder, generates a torque *M* on the induction generator, which is a product of the force *F* and radius of the generator *r*

$$
M = F \cdot r \quad \text{(Eq. 4)}
$$

The power *P*<sub>mech</sub> produced by the harvester and available on the shaft of the induction generator is the product of the induction generator torque *M* and rotational frequency *ω* of the runner of the induction generator:

$$
P_{mech} = M \cdot \omega \quad \text{(Eq. 5)}
$$

Obviously, in the ideal case without friction and losses, the mechanical *P*<sub>mech</sub> and electric power *P*<sub>el</sub> should be equal. 

The above-introduced principle of operation can be used to better understand the design of the H-Hope DIY energy harvesting induction generator presented in the following subsection.

## **Design of the H-Hope DIY energy harvester induction generator**

The DIY induction generator is a radial flux type, in which the permanent magnets and coils are mounted in the radial direction (Figure 1). These are its main parts:
 - plastic stator with pre-assigned positions to mount the coils with ferrite cores (A),
 - three coils with ferrite cores, one for each phase (B),
 - induction generator stator iron core installed in the plastic stator (C),
 - plastic rotor, mounted on the main shaft, with holes for permanent magnets (G),
 - 12 permanent magnets (D),
 - flywheel iron core (F), acting as the ferromagnetic core for the permanent magnets mounted on the rotor and flywheel to ensure the constant rotational frequency of the shaft and the induction generator.

In the proposed design, as said before, a radial-flux induction generator with a fixed distance between the rotor and stator (the so-called “gap”). 

As shown in Figure 1, three coils were used in the stator, while in this case 12 permanent magnets in the rotor. Regarding the choice of the three phases (associated with the three coils), this was driven by the benefits deriving from it, all in line with the DIY approach.  In particular, the use of three phases in electrical systems provides a constant total electric power output over time. Indeed, in a three-phase system, the individual phase currents and voltages are sinusoidal and offset by 120 degrees from each other. As a result, while the electric power in each individual phase fluctuates, the sum of the electric powers from all three phases remains steady. This constant total electric power over time eliminates pulsations that would otherwise occur in a single-phase system, leading to smoother operation of induction generators and motors, reduced mechanical vibrations, and improved efficiency in power transmission and distribution. 

The angle, at which the stator coils are mounted one against the other, is different from the angle of the permanent magnets to reduce the cogging effect. As it can be seen in Figure 1, the central coil of the induction generator is in line with the permanent magnet, while the two other ones are not.

The permanent magnets are arranged in reverse order, as indicated in Figure 10 above (N/S, S/N, N/S, S/N, etc.). A total of 12 permanent magnets are used on the runner. The magnets and coils used are of the common type and can be purchased on well-known web-based online retail services like Alibaba, Farnell, Mauser, AliExpress, etc.

## **Scaling law**
The electric power output of induction generators increases with rotational frequency because the amount of mechanical energy converted into electrical energy grows as the rotor spins faster. In such cases, the rate of change of magnetic flux *Φ*<sub>m</sub> increases approximately linearly and so does the induced voltage *U*<sub>i</sub>. For the case of the sample induction generator in Figure 2, the dependence on rotational frequency is clearly shown in Figure 3, where different load and rotation frequencies were considered and compared.
